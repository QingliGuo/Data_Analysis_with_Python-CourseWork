# Data Analysis with Python

I completed this course in 2020 and switched to Python afterwards. It is a brilliant course developed by Dr. Jarkko Toivonen who is a Bioinformatician and Computational-Biologist. 

I highly recommended it for learning python as a data scientist. You can take it without the UH student ID as it is an OPEN FREE course.
